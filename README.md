The purpose of this D3 visualization is to represent how small differences in student younger grades can lead to much larger differences in middle school. We use data from the NWEA student [norm study](http://legacysupport.nwea.org/sites/www.nwea.org/files/resources/NWEA%202011%20Norms%20Report_01.17.2012_2.pdf) to simulate the typical trajectory of a student at each starting point. 

The NWEA study produced data on conditional expected schoolyear growth of students based on their starting point in the fall. The nwea study data is included as two files `nwea_expected_growth_map.csv` and `nwea_ongrade_rit.csv`.
